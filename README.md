### Why Scala?

Scala is a reliable and quality Discord bot made in Eris and TypeScript that does not store private information or analyze any messages from its server.
- Scala is written with the new technologies. The Scala core is developed with the best and lightest technologies to date.
- 100ms of ping is already a failure for us. We take great care of Scala's response time, which is kept at 50ms. Exceeding 150ms would be a failure for our infrastructure and for our hosting. At 200ms, Scala would start sending high latency warnings to developers.
- You don't pay for Scala, it's free. Our main goal is for Scala to be 100% free for all users.
- We support privacy and innovation. Scala has two things very clear: not to save your information if you don't want to, and to develop innovative functions that solve real problems in Discord. We do not analyze any message from your server, nor do we save your data, we just do not limit it to function.
- Stability. The Scala infrastructure is prepared to detect errors quickly and that those errors do not crash or damage other parts of the code, so we have a great uptime. More than 30 minutes of downtime we would consider it a failure for our code and for development.
